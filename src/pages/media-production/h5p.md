H5P activities are not often used within OPT course builds, but can be used for small micro-interactions which require connection with MyUni
or graded activities.

### How to use H5P

We have been provided access to H5P.com, a hosted version of H5P managed by the Learning Systems and Innovation team in LEI. The key contact here is Mark Wittervan to discuss improvements or tweaks.
