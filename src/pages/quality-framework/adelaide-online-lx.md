Informed by Australian Department of Education and Training’s published report,  *Innovative Approaches for Enhancing the 21st Century Student Experience : Final Report* (Coates, 2017), the Adelaide Online Learning Experience has been developed as a way to embed a student-centric perspective into the design, development and delivery of online courses.It sets clear expectations for students and staff involved and ensures a quality experience for University’s online programs. A University of Adelaide online course is:

- Articulates each activity with purpose and intention.
- Contextualises learning in the real-world.
- Tests learning with appropriately timed, varied and suitable assessments.
- Delivers content that is contemporary and relevant.

<h3 class="adx-markup-block-primary">Interactive</h3>
