<h3 class="adx-markup-block-primary">Stock imagery</h3> 

Stock photography should only be used when no other suitable imagery is available and where the use of a photograph would contribute to the learner experience.

The University of Adelaide has some strict guidelines to follow when selecting stock imagery. Some things that should be considered are:

- That the image you have selected is already being used in another context which may lead to a less authentic experience and potentially harm the university’s brand or reputation.
- That the image may not look relevant and/or authentic to the learning context.
- That the locations, talent or objects may not portray an accurate reflection the content being taught.

<h3 class="adx-markup-block-primary">Image guidelines</h3> 

Imagery selected for course use should be purpose driven, feel natural and modern, convey emotion and be of high production value.

If photography or footage including people is required, it is recommended that real staff and students are used to ensure that images are authentic and University focused, whenever possible.

Some characteristics to look for when sourcing imagery are:

- Prestige
- Leadership
- Innovation
- Excellence
- Discovery, and
- Relevance.
