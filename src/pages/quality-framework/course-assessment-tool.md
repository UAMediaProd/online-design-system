title: Online course assessment tool
tags: ['nav', 'qf']
---

This course assessment tool has been developed to assist in measuring the quality of the student learning experience. The five descriptors of the experience - Clear, Contextual, Interactive, Challenging and Personalised - provide a framework for aligning the Quality Matters Framework, the University's learning and teaching strategy and contemporary learning design and development.

The tool provides a failure point (0) and a baseline level (1) for the minimum requirements of a University of Adelaide online course. The additional levels, (2) & (3), provide direction for improvement and extension beyond the baseline. This helps to define the scope of the student's learning experience and allows key aspects of the course to be extended and enhanced. The purpose of the tool is not to achieve the highest marks across all aspects of the course, but where appropriate, the course can extend into these higher levels. A balanced course should include scores from across the 1-2-3 spectrum.
