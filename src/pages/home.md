The Online Programs team are a multi-disciplinary group of learning designers, video producers, resource developers and project managers who create online learning content at the University of Adelaide. The team offer an end-to-end design and development service which starts at program design and ends with live courses being delivered to students. 

This online resource has been developed to provide staff at the university insight into the tools, processes and methodology used throughout the course development process.

<h3 class="adx-markup-block-primary">Snowball agility</h3> 

Online Programs Team works in an agile way. Our approach to course development is more Snowball than Waterfall. This means we develop the course through iterations rather than stages. We start with an overview of the course and as we move through the iterations add more layers - learning outcomes, assessment, lessons and then the activities and course content. 

This provides us with a number of benefits:
- An ability to adjust to change
- Reduce the risks and pressure as time goes on
- Focus effort and reduce wasted time and energy

1. Pre-work - collating existing ideas, resources & materials.
2. Design - shape & structure of the intended course content to ensure alignment.
3. Writing - create storyboards (text documents) of the entire course. At the 75% complete stage we review of all aspects of the course content & experience.
4. Production - Media team create of videos, graphics & interactive materials and build the course in platform.
5. Review - faculty and team review of course and do final checks.
