The Online Programs team are a multi-disciplinary group of learning designers, video producers, resource developers and project managers who create online learning content at the University of Adelaide. The team offer an end-to-end design and development service which starts at program design and ends with live courses being delivered to students. 

This online resource has been developed to provide staff at the university insight into the tools, processes and methodology used throughout the course development process.

The Online Programs Team have been developing online courses for a number of years and have evolved a process of working that challenges the default 'waterfall approach' and flips it. We could describe it using buzzword terms such as 'agile' (which it is) but that doesn’t actually describe what is going on or how it’s really different to previous methods. Think of it as a snowball instead. 

To start off, you just need something small, something to build around. As you roll the snowball, it picks up more snow and more momentum, which helps to shape the snowball itself. Parts that were loose fall away but everything keeps moving along. Each rotation is an iteration that builds on the last. The snowball starts and finishes as a whole. It’s never broken up into pieces because that would destroy its structure and integrity.
