<h3 class="adx-markup-block-primary">Graphic style</h3> 

Care should be taken when creating or using graphics to ensure they are aligned to our brand and maintain a high-level creative production value. The University Brand Standards do not endorse the use of ‘clip art’ on communication materials as they don’t add creative or brand value.

Although there are no exact rules when designing graphic content for online courses, it is important to remain within the bounds of the University graphic examples which embody the following attributes:

- Simple ‘infographic’ and iconic styling
- Use of university colours
- Use of Bureau Grot Condensed Bold font for labels and pull text
- Use of Open Sans Regular for secondary text
- Limit to the number of words and characters in your graphic
- Informative use of iconic graphic elements
- Clean lines and simple shapes
- Avoid over complicated or stylized graphic elements
- Use of horizontal rules and outer boxes to contain content, and
- Ensure contrast and accessibility has been considered.

<h3 class="adx-markup-block-primary">Icon fonts</h3> 

The University of Adelaide brand stipulates that Font Awesome should be used as the only icon font. When using icon fonts you must apply the following markup, which includes the fa and fa-fw CSS classes.

    <i class="fa fa-fw [icon-class-name]" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"></i>

The [icon-class-name] can be replaced by any of the font icon classes found on the font awesome icons page. Your must only use version 4.7.0 of the font awesome icons.
