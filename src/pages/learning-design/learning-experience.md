During the establishment of the Online Programs Team we were asked to develop a [Quality Framework](http://tinyurl.com/alliance-quality-framework) to ensure that our courses in our portfolio could be assessed and measured. This threw up an interesting challenge - how do you define quality?

The standard approach is to look at specific external indicators or objects that can measured and quantified. That often leads to an approach that is based on checklists, templates and standardisation. Our aim was to not use those measures, but instead to focus on meeting the needs and expectations of the learners themselves - rather than specific features of a course. 

This led to defining the [Adelaide Online Learning Experience](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkhLNQQerji4yn3vKQLvnCUS2OtWBLqcQEssxP7-f2U/edit?usp=sharing) as part of the Quality Framework. This simple set of definitions outlined the kind of experience we want students at the University of Adelaide to have when they study here. It was based on existing strategic documents already produced by the university and simply written to focus on the perspective of the student.

### The Quality Framework & Guides
The Alliance Quality Framework consists of a range of documents and tools beyond the Adelaide Online Learning Experience. These include :

- Online Course Requirements Checklist, 
- Online Course Assessment Tool, and 
- Guides for Active Learning, Assessments, Content Writing, Discussion Boards, Group Work, Learning Videos, Page Design, Quizzes, Reflective Practice and Rubrics. 

The documents were aimed at providing guidance and assistance to learning designers and course authors involved in the Pearson Alliance and were specifically developed for that audience and program.
