In addition to the defining the experience we have developed a quality framework that helps define what we are trying to achieve. It helps to benchmark our courses against national and international standards. Our way of thinking about quality informed by the student experience. The Online Course Assessment tool provides us not only with a measuring stick, but also a quick and easy way of improving courses.

Sitting behind this is a set of guides that can help with specific elements of online courses with practical advice and examples. 

Most importantly youâ€™ll have a team dedicated to working with you to develop these courses.
